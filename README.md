## 2025 - 2029 -- Five Year Plan

### 11/10/2024

#### Analysis Conclusion

Given my primary career goals of high compensation, geographic alignment, professional growth, work-life balance, and high path ceiling, remaining at GE for 1 year to vest half of the RSUs they offer, then pivoting to a more lucrative career makes the most sense. This year at GE should be used to prepare my skills and resume for a career pivot, meaning I must get the title of software engineer on my resume. Thus, my intermediate goal from now (Nov 2024) onwards is to negotiate a title change at GE, and optimally a raise to LPB from PB.

`jupyter nbconvert --to html analysis.ipynb --TagRemovePreprocessor.remove_input_tags='{"hide_input"}'`

The tag preprocessor competely removes the input of cells with the "hide_input" tag. It was being a major PITA to try to figure out how to properly just add toggleable cells,
so I went with this as good enough.
